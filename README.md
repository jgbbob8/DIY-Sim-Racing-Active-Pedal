# DIY-Sim-Racing-Active-Pedal-Bob-structure

This is my DIY Simucube Active Pedal prototype structure for the DIY Sim Racing Active Pedal proyect from tjfenwick https://github.com/tjfenwick/DIY-Sim-Racing-Active-Pedal

I have found a tiny 200Kg load cell, thats allows shortest travels over the rod for the same amount of pedal grades.
